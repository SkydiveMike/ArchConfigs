This is my config file repository.

Simply git clone in where you want and symlink the files to their proper destination. Everything except for `fstab` and `config` should be in your home directory.

so type: `ln -s {target-filename} {symbolic filename}`, for example for i3: `ln -s config ~/.config/i3/config`

Kind regards,

Japhir
