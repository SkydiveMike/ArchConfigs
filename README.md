This is my config file repository.

Simply git clone in where you want and symlink the files to their proper
destination. You can also just execute the `symlink` file.

For individual entries type: `ln -s {target-filename} {symbolic filename}`, for example for i3: `ln -s i3config ~/.config/i3/config`

Kind regards,

Japhir
